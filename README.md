# stockpredictor
predicts stock prices using LSTM recurrent neural network.

future steps:
* predict stock volatility (and other measures of promise eventually)
* select 'winners'
* create an interactive dashboard such that users can input a stock name or ticket and generate certain outputs
* some sort of implementation of openAI API for fun?
